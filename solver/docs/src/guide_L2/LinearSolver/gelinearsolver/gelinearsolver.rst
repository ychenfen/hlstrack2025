*******************************************************
General Linear Solver (GELINEARSOLVER)
*******************************************************

This function solves a system of linear equation with general matrix along with multiple right-hand side vector.

.. math::
      Ax=B

where :math:`A` is a dense general matrix of size :math:`m \times m`, :math:`x` is a vector that needs to be computed, and :math:`B` is an input vector.
The maximum matrix size supported in FPGA is templated by NMAX.
