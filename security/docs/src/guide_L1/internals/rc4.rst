RC4(Rivest Cipher 4), also called ARC4, is a stream cipher. It is used widely because of its simplicity and remarkable speed.
The length of initial key is not greater 256, 1<=key-length<=256. The encryption and decryption use the same RC4 algorithm as long as input same initial key. 


Implementation
=======================

RC4 consists of two parts: initialization state, generate key stream, and its encryption.
Initial state is derived from input key while the key stream is generated by Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA) based on the inner state.
Inner state is stored in an array with 256 bytes. In each iteration, a byte key is output by PRGA and used to operate bitwise exclusive(XOR) with a byte in plain text.
Its input width is 8 bits, so does output width.
