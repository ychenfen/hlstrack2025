The streamSync synchronizes all streams by sharing a same end-flag stream. Each input data stream has an end-flag stream. After sync, all output streams share one end-flag stream, and each of them is a duplicate of an input stream. That is to say, before output an end-flag, each ouput stream should output a data from corresponding input stream.

.. CAUTION::
  Applicable conditions.

  1. It assumes the input elements in each input stream have the same number.
   
  2. The data type of input stream is same as the one of output.
