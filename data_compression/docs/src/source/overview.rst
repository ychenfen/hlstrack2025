Requirements
------------

Software Platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library is designed to work with AMD Vitis™ 2022.2 and later, and therefore inherits the system requirements of Vitis and XRT.

Supported operating systems are RHEL/CentOS 7.4, 7.5 and Ubuntu® 16.04.4 LTS, 18.04.1 LTS. With CentOS/RHEL 7.4 and 7.5, C++11/C++14 should be enabled via `devtoolset-6 <https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/>`_.

PCIe Accelerator Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hardware modules and kernels are designed to work with AMD Alveo™ U200 and U280 cards.
